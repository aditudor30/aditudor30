# About Me

I am a student of Applied Electronics at the Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology. I have strong interests in deep learning, embedded systems, hardware design and data-driven systems. Through my education and self-driven projects, I aim to grow into a DeepTech Engineer capable of combining software intelligence with hardware systems.

## Education & Background

- Bachelor in Applied Electronics (in progress)  
- Experienced in software and hardware: ML & AI, advanced computer vision knowledge, web development, circuit design, PCB layout, embedded programming  
- Previous internship: I worked as a DevOps Engineer in a project based company 

## Skills & Technologies

- Programming: Python, C , C++, JavaScript  
- Machine Learning / Deep Learning: intermediate-to-advanced knowledge; interest in further study and projects  
- Embedded systems & hardware: circuit design, PCB layout, hardware–software integration  
- Data analytics, telecommunication fundamentals; familiarity with data center, 5G and cloud-related concepts  

## Personal Projects & Repositories

Here are some of my relevant repositories (public) illustrating my skills and interests.  


- **BlindAid**— Description: An implementation of Computer Vision state-of-the-art models when guiding visually impaired people safely, being a virtual guide dog.
- **Resume-Website** — Description: This repository features a website that I created in order to showcase my work in a more novel way.  
- **gitops-repo** — Description: This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end CI/CD lifecycle for a web application using modern DevOps tools and the GitOps methodology.  
- **Custom-Neural-Nets-on-CIFAR** — Description: This repository serves as an experimental way of implementing different arhitectures (such as VGG and ResNet) from scratch and seeing the differences from state-of-the art models.


## Current Focus: Bachelor Thesis, Research & Future Grad Studies

I am currently working on my bachelor thesis — a scientific research project in **3D Motion Object Tracking**. The aim is to design and implement a robust 3D motion tracking system that leverages my background in electronics, embedded systems, and machine learning. I plan to complete and present this thesis in a conference in spring of next year.

Given my interest in advanced topics and deep-tech, after graduation I intend to pursue a **Master’s degree or a research-oriented track**, where I can further explore machine learning / deep learning, hardware-software integration, signal processing or embedded AI.  

## What I am Looking For

At this stage I am open to and actively seeking:  

- Internships or junior-level positions in areas like data analytics, cloud/DevOps, cybersecurity, data-center infrastructure, 5G / telecom, embedded systems, or deep-tech development.  
- Research opportunities (Master’s programs, research assistant positions, collaborative academic projects) especially in fields combining hardware, AI, embedded systems or motion tracking / computer vision / signal processing.  
- Mentorship or involvement in long-term R&D projects where I can contribute with both hardware and software skills.
